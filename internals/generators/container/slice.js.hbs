/*
* {{ properCase name }} Slice
*
* Here we define:
* - The shape of our container's slice of Redux store,
* - All the actions which can be triggered for this slice, including their effects on the store.
*
* Note that, while we are using dot notation in our reducer, we are not actually mutating the state
* manually. Under the hood, we use immer to apply these updates to a new copy of the state.
* Please see https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction for more information.
