Acorn barnacles may also seem to live a stationary life, what with being attached to rocks and such. But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?",

    "Think carefully before you mock the mantis shrimp for its diminutive size. I warn you, it's itching for a fight! A pugilist through and through, this brightly hued fellow packs a punch unparalleled on land or sea. Not only are its forelimbs shaped like clubs and scythes, its arms are naturally spring-loaded too! Thus the mantis shrimp's high-speed blows crack open crabs and oyster shells with ease. And should you grab it with your hands, you might discover why it's called \"the thumb splitter\" too!",

    "Try not to gawk as you look upon the sea pineapple. Its peculiar look is simply one of nature's many jokes. Though it may look like a half-rotten hunk of fruit, the sea pineapple is no plant, shellfish, or even sea slug. It's a tunicate, wot wot...a fancy name for a shallow-water filter feeder with a taste for plankton. It should be noted that the sea pineapple looks like a tadpole when it's young and can still swim about. Alas, its youthful cuteness wears off once it attaches itself for good to a rock. Ah, but let's put insults aside! Sea pineapples are full of water, you sea. And I fear we're asking for a squirt in the eye!",

    "The turban shell is a sea snail with a rather nifty trick up its sleeve...er, shell. You see, this snail carries a hard, round, button-like \"operculum\" with it wherever it goes. What is an operculum, you ask? Why, it is a trapdoor of sorts! When danger approaches, the snail slips into its shell and pulls this trapdoor closed over the opening. Thus it is locked safe and sound inside. And bravo, I say! Bravo! When trouble comes knocking, just do what the turban shell does. Shut the door and turn out the lights!",

    "My feathers, could there be a more adorable sea creature than the umbrella octopus? I daresay not! These deep-sea octopuses are on the smallish side and use the cutest ear-like fins to flutter about. Meanwhile, it's the web stretched between their tentacles that gives them their name. Hoo, it's true! With arms stretched wide, they look for all the world like an umbrella! Though surely the last thing the umbrella octopus wants...is to stay dry.",

The Vampire Squid does, in fact, live deep in the ocean where almost no light pervades. But while it looks like it could nibble on your neck...it nibbles on the bits of dead plankton and algae instead. By all accounts, the vampire squid is a a gentle sort who squirts bioluminecesant goo at foes. Sp, how did it get the eerie official name \"Vampyroteuthis inernalis\"? That means \"vampire squid from the heck,\" you see. The problem is that the squid's \"cloak.\" Its arms are webbed with velvet-red skin and lined with toothy spikes. Plainly put, this genial squid looks for all the world like a vampire who went for a swim.",

In fact, these wily snails have been known to use their own shells to pry open the shells of their victims! They then use a rough tongue-like organ with thousands of tiny teeth to lick their victims' shells clean. Eh... you might want to put that image out of your mind when it's your turn to dine.",
